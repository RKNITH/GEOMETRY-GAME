Sometimes I get the sense that there is more to this world than meets the eye...
Like there is something my sensory input cannot access.

Something that makes the world tick. Some kind of rules, some underlying logic.

The world is so complicated and vast. \n If only I knew why things are the way they are.

I can write down a guess, an equation. But I know they are only my 
humble approximations of something so much bigger than myself.

I wish I could see the structure of reality. But I am just a little robot.
I can only measure, and graph, and model, and imagine.
